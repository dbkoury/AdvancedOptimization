# AdvancedOptimization

This code is designed to show how to use the pulp package with python loops and dynamic variables 
to tackle optimization problems involving multiple indexed sets with multiple variables
that lead to a multitude of constraints that would be difficult to write one by one

The nature of the code first generates random numbers to act as the data for the problem
While random, the numbers are manipulated to conform to a general standard based upon the data type

  Ex. Processing Capacity is in thousands, shipping costs are in dollar value
  
After the data is created, the variables and constraints and optimization equation are made 
based upon the formulas which can be found in the word file from the repository

Lastly, the optimal values are printed. 

Due to the random nature of the data, there may not always be an optimal solution.
To combat this, and if statement was used to loop the program until random data is created 
that can provide an optimal solution.

Below I have provided a link to a video that will explain the code as well:
